# GANs Specialization

GANs Specialization made by deeplearning.ai (Generative Adversarial Networks Specialization)

This 3-course specialization is launched on September 30. Right now the repository contains files for Course 1, 2. The assignment files are already completed.

Further files of Course 3 will be uploaded when the courses go live.

## Edits
Update 1: Made this repository public for reference (on September 30, 2020)

Update 2: Course 1 and 2 final materials added on (09/29/2020). Large sized files can be downloaded from Coursera.

Update 3: I have decided to only upload the ipynb files of the assignments as notebooks does not require any reference and the additional required files (dataset/utils.py etc) can be accessed from Coursera.


## Usage

Use the assignment files with prefilled code for reference only.
